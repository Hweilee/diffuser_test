# Schedulers

The base class ['SchedulerMixin'] implements low level utilities used by multiple schedulers.
At a high level:
- Schedulers are the algorithms to use diffusion models in inference as well as for training. They include the noise schedules and define algorithm-specific diffusion steps.
- Schedulers can be used interchangable between diffusion models in inference to find the preferred tradef-off between speed and generation quality.
- Schedulers are available in numpy, but can easily be transformed into PyTorch.

## What is a scheduler?

## Discrete versus Continuous schedulers

## API

- Schedulers should provide one or more `def step(...)` functions that should be called iteratively to unroll the diffusion loop during
the forward pass.
- Schedulers should be framework-agonstic, but provide a simple functionality to convert the scheduler into a specific framework, such as PyTorch
with a `set_format(...)` method.
