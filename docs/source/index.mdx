# ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

ðŸ¤— Diffusers provides pretrained vision diffusion models, and serves as a modular toolbox for inference and training.

More precisely, ðŸ¤— Diffusers offers:

- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines that can be run in inference with just a couple of lines of code (see [**Using Diffusers**](./using-diffusers/conditional_image_generation)) or have a look at [**Pipelines**](./api/pipelines) to get an overview of all supported pipelines and their corresponding papers.
- Various noise schedulers that can be used interchangeably for the prefered speed vs. quality trade-off in inference. For more information see [**Schedulers**](./api/schedulers).
- Multiple types of models, such as UNet, can be used as building blocks in an end-to-end diffusion system. See [**Models**](./api/models) for more details 
- Training examples to show how to train the most popular diffusion model tasks. For more information see [**Training**](./training/overview).
