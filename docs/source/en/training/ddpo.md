# Reinforcement learning training with DDPO

It is possible to leverage the ðŸ¤— `trl` library along with `diffusers` to fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a reward function via reinforcement learning. This is done via an algorithm called Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO), introduced by Black et al. in [Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301). ðŸ¤— `trl` implements a dedicated trainer class for this `DDPOTrainer`.
