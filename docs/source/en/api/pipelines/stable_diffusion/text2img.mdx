# Text-to-Image

The Stable Diffusion model was created by researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), [Runway](https://github.com/runwayml), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). The [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] is capable of generating photorealistic images given any text input.

| Stable Diffusion version | Repository                                                                      |

| v2                       | [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) |

Additional official checkpoints for different versions of the Stable Diffusion model can be found on the [CompVis](https://huggingface.co/CompVis), [Runway](https://huggingface.co/runwayml), and [Stability AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai) organizations on the Hub.
