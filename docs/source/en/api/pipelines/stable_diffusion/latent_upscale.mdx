# Stable-Diffusion-Latent-Upscaler

## StableDiffusionLatentUpscalePipeline

The Stable Diffusion Latent Upscaler model was created by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) in collaboration with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/). It can be used on top of any [`StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline`] checkpoint to enhance its output image resolution from 512 x 512 to 1024 x 1024.

The original implementation can be found here: 
- [Stable Diffusion Upscaler Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o1qYJcFeywzCIdkfKJy7cTpgZTCM2EI4)

Available Checkpoints are:
- *stabilityai/latent-upscaler*: [stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler)
