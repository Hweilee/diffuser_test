# Stable Diffusion 2

Stable Diffusion 2 is a text-to-image _latent diffusion_ model built upon the work of the original [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), and it was led by Robin Rombach and Katherine Crowson from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/).

*The Stable Diffusion 2.0 release includes robust text-to-image models trained using a brand new text encoder (OpenCLIP), developed by LAION with support from Stability AI, which greatly improves the quality of the generated images compared to earlier V1 releases. The text-to-image models in this release can generate images with default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels. 
These models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the [LAION-5B dataset](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using [LAIONâ€™s NSFW filter](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3Y74vmsMcY).*

For more details about how Stable Diffusion 2 works and how it differs from the original Stable Diffusion, please refer to the official [announcement post](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release).

<Tip>

The architecture of Stable Diffusion 2 is more or less identical to the original [Stable Diffusion model](./stable_diffusion/text2img) so check out it's API documentation for how to use Stable Diffusion 2. We recommend using the [`DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`] as it's currently the fastest scheduler.

</Tip>

Stable Diffusion 2 is available for a tasks like inpainting, super-resolution and depth-to-image:
