# Inpaint

The Stable Diffusion model can also be applied to inpainting which lets you edit specific parts of an image by providing a mask and a text prompt using Stable Diffusion.

| Stable Diffusion version | Repository                                                                                                             |

Additional official checkpoints for different versions of the Stable Diffusion model for inpainting can be found on the [Runway](https://huggingface.co/runwayml), and [Stability AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai) organizations on the Hub.

<Tip>

It is recommended to use this pipeline with checkpoints that have been specifically fine-tuned for inpainting, such
as [runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting). Default
text-to-image Stable Diffusion checkpoints, such as
[runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) are also compatible with
this pipeline but might be less performant.
