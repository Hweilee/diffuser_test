# Depth-to-Image

The Stable Diffusion model can also infer depth based on an image using [MiDas](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS). This allows you to pass a text prompt and an initial image to condition the generation of new images as well as a `depth_map` to preserve the image structure. 

The original codebase can be found at [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion#depth-conditional-stable-diffusion) and additional official checkpoints for depth-to-image can be found at [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-depth](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-depth).
