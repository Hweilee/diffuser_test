# Attend and Excite

Attend and Excite for Stable Diffusion was proposed in [Attend-and-Excite: Attention-Based Semantic Guidance for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://attendandexcite.github.io/Attend-and-Excite/) and provides textual attention control over the image generation.

The abstract of the paper is the following:

*Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received a lot of interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from text only. However, achieving one-shot generation that aligns with the user's intent is nearly impossible, yet small changes to the input prompt often result in very different images. This leaves the user with little semantic control. To put the user in control, we show how to interact with the diffusion process to flexibly steer it along semantic directions. This semantic guidance (SEGA) allows for subtle and extensive edits, changes in composition and style, as well as optimizing the overall artistic conception. We demonstrate SEGA's effectiveness on a variety of tasks and provide evidence for its versatility and flexibility.*

## Tips

- The Attend and Excite pipeline can be used with any [Stable Diffusion](./api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img) checkpoint.

### Run Attend and Excite

The interface of [`StableDiffusionAttendAndExcitePipeline`] provides several additional parameters to influence the image generation.
Exemplary usage may look like this:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionAttendAndExcitePipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionAttendAndExcitePipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to(device)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a cat and a frog"
indices_to_alter=[2, 5]
seed = 6141
g = torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(seed)
prompts = [prompt]

outputs = pipe(
    prompt=prompts,
    indices_to_alter=indices_to_alter,
    attention_res=16,
    guidance_scale=7.5,
    generator=g,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    max_iter_to_alter=25,
    run_standard_sd=True, # set to False for default model
    thresholds={0: 0.05, 10: 0.5, 20: 0.8},
    scale_factor=20,
    scale_range=(1.0, 0.5),
    smooth_attentions=True,
    sigma=0.5,
    kernel_size=3,
)

image = outputs.images[0]

stable.show_cross_attention(
    prompt=prompt,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    res=16,
    from_where=("up", "down", "mid"),
    indices_to_alter=indices_to_alter,
    orig_image=image,
)

```
