# AudioLDM

AudioLDM was proposed in [AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2301.12503) by Haohe Liu et al.

Inspired by [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/overview), AudioLDM
is a text-to-audio _latent diffusion model (LDM)_ that learns continuous audio representations from [CLAP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/clap)
latents. AudioLDM takes a text prompt as input and predicts the corresponding audio. It can generate text-conditional
sound effects, human speech and music.

The original codebase can be found at [haoheliu/AudioLDM](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM), and the pipeline was contributed by [sanchit-gandhi](https://huggingface.co/sanchit-gandhi). 

## Tips

When constructing a prompt, keep in mind:

* Descriptive prompt inputs work best; you can use adjectives to describe the sound (for example, "high quality" or "clear") and make the prompt context specific (for example, "water stream in a forest" instead of "stream").
* It's best to use general terms like "cat" or "dog" instead of specific names or abstract objects the model may not be familiar with.

During inference:

* The _quality_ of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by the `num_inference_steps` argument; higher steps give higher quality audio at the expense of slower inference.
* The _length_ of the predicted audio sample can be controlled by varying the `audio_length_in_s` argument.
