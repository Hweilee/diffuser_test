# ControlNet with Stable Diffusion XL

ControlNet-XS was introduced in [ControlNet-XS](https://vislearn.github.io/ControlNet-XS/) by Denis Zavadski and Carsten Rother. It is based on the observation that the control model in the [original ControlNet](https://huggingface.co/papers/2302.05543) can be made much smaller and still produces good results.

As with the original ControlNet model, you can provide an additional control image to condition and control Stable Diffusion generation. For example, if you provide a depth map, the ControlNet model generates an image that'll preserve the spatial information from the depth map. It is a more flexible and accurate way to control the image generation process.

<Tip warning={true}>

ðŸ§ª Many of the SDXL ControlNet checkpoints are experimental, and there is a lot of room for improvement. Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose) and leave us feedback on how we can improve!

</Tip>

If you don't see a checkpoint you're interested in, you can train your own SDXL ControlNet with our [training script](../../../../../examples/controlnet/README_sdxl).

<Tip>

Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-components-across-pipelines) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.
