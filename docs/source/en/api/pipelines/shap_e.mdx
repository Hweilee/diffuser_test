# Shap-E

## Overview


The Shap-E model was proposed in [Shap-E: Generating Conditional 3D Implicit Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463) by Alex Nichol and Heewon Jun from [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai). 

The abstract of the paper is the following:

*We present Shap-E, a conditional generative model for 3D assets. Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a single output representation, Shap-E directly generates the parameters of implicit functions that can be rendered as both textured meshes and neural radiance fields. We train Shap-E in two stages: first, we train an encoder that deterministically maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function; second, we train a conditional diffusion model on outputs of the encoder. When trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, our resulting models are capable of generating complex and diverse 3D assets in a matter of seconds. When compared to Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional, multi-representation output space.*

## Use Examples:

In the following, we will walk you through some examples of how to use Shap-E pipelines to create 3D objects in gif format.

#### Text-to-Image generation 

We can use [`ShapEPipeline`] to create 3D object based on a text prompt. In this example, we will make a birthday cupcake. The workflow to use the Shap-E text-to-image pipeline is same as how you would use other text-to-image pipelines in diffusers.

```python
import torch

from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

repo = "openai/shap-e"
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(repo, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

guidance_scale = 15.0
prompt = "A birthday cupcake"

images = pipe(
    prompt, 
    guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
    num_inference_steps= 64, 
    size = 256,
    ).images
```

The output of [`ShapEPipeline`] is a list of lists of images frames. Each list of frames can be used to create a 3D object. Let's use the `export_to_gif` utility function in diffusers to make a 3D cupcake!

```python
from diffusers.utils import export_to_gif

gif_path=export_to_gif(images[0], "cupcake_3d.gif")
```
