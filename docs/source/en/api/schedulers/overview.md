# Schedulers

ðŸ¤— Diffusers provides many scheduler functions for the diffusion process. A scheduler takes a model's output (the sample which the diffusion process is iterating on) and a timestep to return a denoised sample. The timestep is important because it dictates where in the diffusion process the step is; data is generated by iterating forward *n* timesteps and inference occurs by propagating backward through the timesteps. Based on the timestep, a scheduler may be *discrete* in which case the timestep is an `int` or *continuous* in which case the timestep is a `float`.

Depending on the context, a scheduler defines how to iteratively add noise to an image or how to update a sample based on a model's output:

- during *training*, a scheduler adds noise (there are different algorithms for how to add noise) to a sample to train a diffusion model
- during *inference*, a scheduler defines how to update a sample based on a pretrained model's output

All schedulers are built from the base [`SchedulerMixin`] class which implements low level utilities shared by all schedulers.

## KarrasDiffusionSchedulers

`KarrasDiffusionSchedulers` encompasses the main generalization of schedulers in Diffusers. The schedulers in this class are distinguished, at a high level, by their noise sampling strategy; the type of network and scaling; and finally the training strategy or how the loss is weighed.

The different schedulers, depending on the type of ODE solver, fall into the above taxonomy and provide a good abstraction for the design of the main schedulers implemented in Diffusers. The schedulers in this class are given below:
