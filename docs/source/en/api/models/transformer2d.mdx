# Transformer2D

A Transformer model for image-like data. [`Transformer2DModel`] accepts discrete (classes of vector embeddings) or continuous (actual embeddings) inputs.

When the input is **continous**:

1. Project the input and reshape it to `(b, t, d)`.
2. Apply standard Transformer action.
3. Reshape to image.

When the input is **discrete**:

<Tip>

It is assumed one of the input classes is the masked latent pixel. The predicted classes of the unnoised image don't contain a prediction for the masked pixel because the unnoised image cannot be masked.

</Tip>

1. Convert input (classes of latent pixels) to embeddings and apply positional embeddings.
2. Apply standard Transformer action.
3. Predict classes of unnoised image.
