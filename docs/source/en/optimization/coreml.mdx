# How to run Stable Diffusion with Core ML

Core ML is the model format and machine learning library supported by Apple frameworks. If you are interested in running Stable Diffusion models inside your macOS or iOS/iPadOS apps, this guide will tell you how to convert the existing PyTorch checkpoints and use them from native Swift code.

Core ML models can leverage all the compute engines available in Apple devices: the CPU, the GPU, and the Apple Neural Engine (or ANE, a tensor-optimized accelerator available in Apple Silicon Macs and modern iPhones/iPads). Depending on the model and the device it's running on, Core ML is able to mix and match compute engines too, so some portions of the model may run on the CPU while others run on GPU, for example.

<Tip>
You can also run the `diffusers` Python codebase on Apple Silicon Macs using the `mps` accelerator built into PyTorch. This approach is explained in depth in [the `mps` guide](mps), but it is not compatible with native apps.
</Tip>

## Stable Diffusion Core ML Checkpoints

Stable Diffusion was trained using PyTorch, and consequently the model weights (or checkpoints) are available in PyTorch format. We need to convert them to the Core ML format before we can use them inside native apps.

Thankfully, Apple engineers developed [a conversion tool](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml) based on `diffusers`. If you have a Mac, you can use the conversion scripts it provides to convert any Stable Diffusion model to Core ML.

Before you convert a model, though, do take a moment to explore the Hugging Face Hub – chances are the model you're interested in is already available in Core ML format. For example, the official Stable Diffusion models are available in Core ML in [the Apple organization](https://huggingface.co/apple). This includes Stable Diffusion versions 1.4, 1.5, 2.0 base and 2.1 base.

If you are interested in custom Dreamboothed or fine-tuned models, you can take a look at the [`coreml` community organization](https://huggingface.co/coreml) or use [this query to browse](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image&library=coreml&p=2&sort=likes) through all available models.

If you can't find the model you're interested in, we recommend you follow the instructions in [Apple's repo](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml) to perform the conversion yourself.

## Selecting the Core ML Variant to Use

Converted Core ML `diffusers` repos usually contain several model variants that are intended for different purposes. The main categories depend on:

- The type of attention blocks used. The attention operation is the basis of the Transformer architecture, which is used inside Stable Diffusion to "pay attention" to the relationship between different areas in the image representations, and to understand how the image and text representations relate to each other. Attention is compute- and memory-intensive, so different implementations exist that take into account the hardware characteristics of different devices. In the case of Core ML Stable Diffusion models, there are two potential attention variants:
    * `split_einsum` implementation, [previously introduced by Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/neural-engine-transformers). It is particularly optimized for Apple's Neural Engine (ANE) device, which is available in modern iPhones, iPads and M-series computers.
    * The "original" attention implementation, which is the base implementation found in `diffusers` code. This implementation is only compatible with CPU and GPU, but not with the ANE. Note, however, that in can be _faster_ to run your model on CPU + GPU using `original` attention than it is to use the ANE. See [this performance benchmark](https://huggingface.co/blog/fast-mac-diffusers#performance-benchmarks) as well as some [additional measures provided by the community](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers/issues/31) for additional details.

- The supported inference framework.
    * `ML Packages` are suitable for Python inference. This can be used to test converted Core ML models using `diffusers` Python code before attempting to integrate them inside native apps, or if you want to explore Core ML performance but don't need to support native apps. For example, an application with a web UI could perfectly use a Python Core ML backend.
    * `Compiled` models are required for Swift code. The `compiled` models in the Hub split the large UNet model weights in several files for compatibility with iOS and iPadOS devices. This corresponds to the [`--chunk-unet` conversion option](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml). If you want to support native apps, then you need to select one of the "compiled" variants.

The 4 official Stable Diffusion models include these 4 variants, but the community ones may vary. This is the structure followed by the 4 official models:

```
coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4
├── README.md
├── original
│   ├── compiled
│   └── packages
└── split_einsum
    ├── compiled
    └── packages
```

You can download and use the variant you need as shown below.

## Core ML Inference in Python

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
pip install git+https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion
```

### Download the Model Checkpoints

To run inference in Python, you have to use one of the versions stored in the `packages` folders, because the compiled ones are only compatible with Swift. You may choose whether you want to use the `original` or `split_einsum` attention styles.

This is how you'd download the `original` attention variant from the Hub:

```Python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
from pathlib import Path

repo_id = "apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4"
variant = "original/packages"

model_path = Path("./models") / (repo_id.split("/")[-1] + "_" + variant.replace("/", "_"))
snapshot_download(repo_id, allow_patterns=f"{variant}/*", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False)
print(f"Model downloaded at {model_path}")
```

The code above will place the downloaded model snapshot inside a directory called `models`.

### Inference[[python-inference]]

Once you have downloaded a snapshot of the model, you can test it using Apple's Python script.

```shell
python -m python_coreml_stable_diffusion.pipeline --prompt "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars" -i models/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4_original_packages -o </path/to/output/image> --compute-unit CPU_AND_GPU --seed 93
```

`<output-mlpackages-directory>` should point to the checkpoint you downloaded in the step above, and `--compute-unit` indicates the hardware you want to allow for inference. It must be one of the following options: `ALL`, `CPU_AND_GPU`, `CPU_ONLY`, `CPU_AND_NE`. You may also provide an optional output path, and a seed for reproducibility.

The inference script assumes the original version of the Stable Diffusion model, stored in the Hub as `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4`. If you use another model, you _have_ to specify its Hub id in the inference command-line, using the `--model-version` option. This works both for models already supported, and for custom models you trained or fine-tuned yourself.

For Stable Diffusion 1.5 (Hub id: `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`):

```shell
python -m python_coreml_stable_diffusion.pipeline --prompt "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars" --compute-unit ALL -o output --seed 93 -i models/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-5_original_packages --model-version runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
```


## Core ML inference in Swift

Running inference in Swift is slightly faster than in Python, because the models are already compiled in the `mlmodelc` format. This will be noticeable on app startup when the model is loaded, but shouldn’t be noticeable if you run several generations afterwards.

### Download

To run inference in Swift on your Mac, you need one of the `compiled` checkpoint versions. We recommend you download them locally using Python code similar to the one we showed above, but using one of the `compiled` variants:

```Python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
from pathlib import Path

repo_id = "apple/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4"
variant = "original/compiled"

model_path = Path("./models") / (repo_id.split("/")[-1] + "_" + variant.replace("/", "_"))
snapshot_download(repo_id, allow_patterns=f"{variant}/*", local_dir=model_path, local_dir_use_symlinks=False)
print(f"Model downloaded at {model_path}")
```

### Inference[[swift-inference]]

To run inference, please clone Apple's repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion
cd ml-stable-diffusion
```

And then use Apple's command-line tool using Swift Package Manager's facilities:

```bash
swift run StableDiffusionSample --resource-path models/coreml-stable-diffusion-v1-4_original_compiled --compute-units all "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
```

You have to specify in `--resource-path` one of the checkpoints downloaded in the previous step, so please make sure it contains compiled Core ML bundles with the extension `.mlmodelc`. The `--compute-units` has to be one of these values: `all`, `cpuOnly`, `cpuAndGPU`, `cpuAndNeuralEngine`.

For more details, please refer to the [instructions in Apple's repo](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion).


## Supported `diffusers` Features

The Core ML models and inference code don't support the vast amount of features, options and flexibility of the Python code base. These are some of the limitations to keep in mind:

- Core ML models are only suitable for inference. They can't be used for training or fine-tuning.
- Only two schedulers have been ported to Swift: the default one used by Stable Diffusion, and `DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`, which we ported to Swift from our `diffusers` implementation. We recomment you use `DPMSolverMultistepScheduler`, as it produces the same quality in about half the steps.
- Negative prompts, classifier-free guidance scale and image to image tasks are available in the inference code. Advanced features such as depth guidance, ControlNet, latent upscalers, etc., are not available yet.

Both Apple's [conversion and inference repo](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion) and our own [swift-coreml-diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers) are intended as technology demonstrators to enable other developers to build upon them. If you feel strongly about any missing features, please feel free to open a feature request or, better yet, a contribution PR :)

## Native Diffusers Swift app

One easy way to run Stable Diffusion on your own Apple hardware is to use [our open-source Swift repo](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers), based on `diffusers` and Apple's conversion and inference repo. You can study the code, compile it with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and adapt it for your own needs. For your convenience, there's also a [standalone Mac app in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/diffusers/id1666309574), so you can play with it without having to deal with the code or IDE. If you are a developer and have determined that Core ML is the best solution to build your Stable Diffusion app, then you can use the rest of this guide to get started with your project. We can't wait to see what you'll build :)
