# Quicktour

Get up and running with ðŸ§¨ Diffusers quickly!
Whether you're a developer or an everyday user, this quick tour will help you get started and show you how to use [`DiffusionPipeline`] for inference.

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers
```

## DiffusionPipeline

The [`DiffusionPipeline`] is the easiest way to use a pretrained diffusion system for inference. You can use the [`DiffusionPipeline`] out-of-the-box for many tasks across different modalities. Take a look at the table below for some supported tasks:

| **Task**                     | **Description**                                                                                              | **Pipeline**
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Unconditional Image Generation          | generate an image from gaussian noise | [unconditional_image_generation](./using-diffusers/unconditional_image_generation.mdx`) |
| Text-Guided Image Generation | generate    | generate an image given a text prompt | [conditional_image_generation](./using-diffusers/conditional_image_generation.mdx) |
| Text-Guided Image-to-Image Translation     | generate an image given an original image and a text prompt | [img2img](./using-diffusers/img2img.mdx) |
| Text-Guided Image-Inpainting          | fill the masked part of an image given the image, the mask and a text prompt | [inpaint](./using-diffusers/inpaint.mdx) |

Start by creating an instance of [`DiffusionPipeline`] and specifying which pipeline checkpoint you would like to download. You can use the [`DiffusionPipeline`] for any [Diffusers' checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads). In this guide though, you'll use [`DiffusionPipeline`] for text-to-image generation with [Latent Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/ldm-text2im-large-256):

```py
>>> from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

>>> generator = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/ldm-text2im-large-256")
```

The [`DiffusionPipeline`] downloads and caches all modeling, tokenization and scheduling components. 
Because the model consists of roughly 1.4 billion parameters, we strongly recommend running it on GPU.
You can move the generator object to GPU, just like you would in PyTorch.

```py
>>> generator.to("cuda")
```

Now you can use the `generator` on your text prompt:

```py
>>> image = generator("An image of a squirrel in Picasso style").images[0]
```

The output is by default wrapped into a [PIL Image object](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html?highlight=image#the-image-class).

You can save the image by simply calling:

```py
>>> image.save("image_of_squirrel_painting.png")
```

More advanced models, like [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) require you to accept a [license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) before running the model due to the improved image generation capabilities of the model.
